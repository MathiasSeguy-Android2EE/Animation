# Animation
This project is the support for the DroidCon Gr, DroidCon London and DroidCon Paris 2015 conferences I gave about animation.
This project is a tutorial about Android Animation.
It contains code for Drawable animations, ViewProperty, CustomView, ObjectAnimator, recyclerView, CoordinatorLayout, ViewPager and PageTransformer, ActivityTransition and Scene Transition.
It works from Gingerbread (damn it) to Marshmallow.
You have all the code you need to make great animations in your applications.
Enjoy.
